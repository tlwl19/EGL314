<br>

<br>

## **Creating the Frames**
<br>

We will need to create the first frame, which is for the 3x4 grid.

```
inguessframe = Frame(guessframe)
inguessframe.grid(row=1, column=0)

imageFrame = Frame(guessframe)
imageFrame.grid(row=0, column=1)

inputrow = 6    
inputcolumn = 4

```

Next, we will create the second frame, which is for the GUESS button.

```
inguessframe2 = Frame(guessframe)
inguessframe2.grid(row=1, column=1)

guessbtn = Button(inguessframe2, text="GUESS!!", font=('Arial',20), command=guess)
guessbtn.grid(row=0, column=1)

```

Lastly, we will need to create the third frame, which is for the START button, RESET button, and SCORE.

```
inguessframe3 = Frame(guessframe)
inguessframe3.grid(row=1, column=2)

startbtn = Button(inguessframe3, text="START GAME", font=('Arial', 20), bg='yellow', command=startgame)
startbtn.grid(row=0, column=2)

resetbtn = Button(inguessframe3, text="RESET GAME", font=('Arial', 20), bg='pink', command=restartgame)
resetbtn.grid(row=1, column=2)

scorename = Label(inguessframe3, text="Score", font=('Arial', 25)) 
scorename.grid(row=2, column=2)

scoreresults = Label(inguessframe3, text=str(score), font=('Arial', 20))
scoreresults.grid(row=3, column=2)

youwin = Label(inguessframe3, text="Press Reset Game to Reset", font=('Arial', 12))
youwin.grid(row=4, column=2)
youwin.grid_forget()

```

After the frames have been created, we will start to create the buttons in the 3x4 grid. 

```
for r in range(inputrow):
    for c in range(inputcolumn):
        # Button Section
        btn0 = Button(inguessframe, text = "Aquarius", font = ("Arial", 15), height=5, width=10, bg='white', fg='black', command=lambda m=0:horobutton(m))
        lbl0 = Label(inguessframe, text="Aquarius", font=("Arial", 15), fg='black')
        btn1 = Button(inguessframe, text = "Aries", font = ("Arial", 15), height=5, width=10, bg='white', fg='black', command=lambda m=1:horobutton(m))
        lbl1 = Label(inguessframe, text="Aries", font=("Arial", 15), fg='black')
        btn2 = Button(inguessframe, text = "Cancer", font = ("Arial", 15), height=5, width=10, bg='white', fg='black',command=lambda m=2:horobutton(m))
        lbl2 = Label(inguessframe, text="Cancer", font=("Arial", 15), fg='black')
        btn3 = Button(inguessframe, text = "Capricorn", font = ("Arial", 15), height=5, width=10, bg='white', fg='black',command=lambda m=3:horobutton(m))
        lbl3 = Label(inguessframe, text="Capricorn", font=("Arial", 15), fg='black')
        btn4 = Button(inguessframe, text = "Gemini", font = ("Arial", 15), height=5, width=10, bg='white', fg='black',command=lambda m=4:horobutton(m))
        lbl4 = Label(inguessframe, text="Gemini", font=("Arial", 15), fg='black')
        btn5 = Button(inguessframe, text = "Leo", font = ("Arial", 15), height=5, width=10, bg='white', fg='black',command=lambda m=5:horobutton(m))
        lbl5 = Label(inguessframe, text="Leo", font=("Arial", 15), fg='black')
        btn6 = Button(inguessframe, text = "Libra", font = ("Arial", 15), height=5, width=10, bg='white', fg='black',command=lambda m=6:horobutton(m))
        lbl6 = Label(inguessframe, text="Libra", font=("Arial", 15), fg='black')
        btn7 = Button(inguessframe, text = "Pisces", font = ("Arial", 15), height=5, width=10, bg='white', fg='black',command=lambda m=7:horobutton(m))
        lbl7 = Label(inguessframe, text="Pisces", font=("Arial", 15),fg='black')
        btn8 = Button(inguessframe, text = "Sagittarius", font = ("Arial", 15), height=5, width=10, bg='white', fg='black',command=lambda m=8:horobutton(m))
        lbl8 = Label(inguessframe, text="Sagittarius", font=("Arial", 15), fg='black')
        btn9 = Button(inguessframe, text = "Scorpio", font = ("Arial", 15), height=5, width=10, bg='white', fg='black',command=lambda m=9:horobutton(m))
        lbl9 = Label(inguessframe, text="Scorpio", font=("Arial", 15), fg='black')
        btn10 = Button(inguessframe, text = "Taurus", font = ("Arial", 15), height=5, width=10, bg='white', fg='black',command=lambda m=10:horobutton(m))
        lbl10 = Label(inguessframe, text="Taurus", font=("Arial", 15), fg='black')
        btn11 = Button(inguessframe, text = "Virgo", font = ("Arial", 15), height=5, width=10, bg='white', fg='black',command=lambda m=11:horobutton(m))
        lbl11 = Label(inguessframe, text="Virgo", font=("Arial", 15), fg='black')

btn0.grid(row=0, column=0)
lbl0.grid(row=1, column=0)
btn1.grid(row=0, column=1)
lbl1.grid(row=1, column=1)
btn2.grid(row=0, column=2)
lbl2.grid(row=1, column=2)
btn3.grid(row=0, column=3)
lbl3.grid(row=1, column=3)
btn4.grid(row=2, column=0)
lbl4.grid(row=3, column=0)
btn5.grid(row=2, column=1)
lbl5.grid(row=3, column=1)
btn6.grid(row=2, column=2)
lbl6.grid(row=3, column=2)
btn7.grid(row=2, column=3)
lbl7.grid(row=3, column=3)

btn8.grid(row=4, column=0)
lbl8.grid(row=5, column=0)
btn9.grid(row=4, column=1)
lbl9.grid(row=5, column=1)
btn10.grid(row=4, column=2)
lbl10.grid(row=5, column=2)
btn11.grid(row=4, column=3)
lbl11.grid(row=5, column=3)

```

We will then need to insert the images of the horoscope symbols onto our buttons.

```
for i in range(0, 12):
    path = "horo/" + str(i) + ".png"
    myImage = Image.open(path)
    myImage = myImage.resize((100, 100))
    loadImage = ImageTk.PhotoImage(myImage)
    widthx = 114
    heightx = 126
    if i == 0:
        btn0.image = loadImage
        btn0.config(image = loadImage, width=widthx, height=heightx)
    elif i == 1:
        btn1.image = loadImage
        btn1.config(image = loadImage, width=widthx, height=heightx)
    elif i == 2:
        btn2.image = loadImage
        btn2.config(image = loadImage, width=widthx, height=heightx)
    elif i == 3:
        btn3.image = loadImage
        btn3.config(image = loadImage, width=widthx, height=heightx)
    elif i == 4:
        btn4.image = loadImage
        btn4.config(image = loadImage, width=widthx, height=heightx)
    elif i == 5:
        btn5.image = loadImage
        btn5.config(image = loadImage, width=widthx, height=heightx)
    elif i == 6:
        btn6.image = loadImage
        btn6.config(image = loadImage, width=widthx, height=heightx)
    elif i == 7:
        btn7.image = loadImage
        btn7.config(image = loadImage, width=widthx, height=heightx)
    elif i == 8:
        btn8.image = loadImage
        btn8.config(image = loadImage, width=widthx, height=heightx)
    elif i == 9:
        btn9.image = loadImage
        btn9.config(image = loadImage, width=widthx, height=heightx)
    elif i == 10:
        btn10.image = loadImage
        btn10.config(image = loadImage, width=widthx, height=heightx)
    else:
        btn11.image = loadImage
        btn11.config(image = loadImage, width=widthx, height=heightx)
```

# **What's Your Luck?**

**What's Your Luck?** is a game where it .......

![Alt text](markdown%20imgs/luckSS.png)

*What's Your Luck? GUI*

## **Creating the Calendar Dropdown Menu**
<br>

We will first need to create an array of the months in a year.

```
options = ["January", "Febuary", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"]
optionss = []
d = 32
for x in range (1, d):
    optionss.append(x)
```

Datatype of menu text (??)

```
clicked = StringVar()
clickeds = IntVar()

who = date.today()
whos = options[who.month-1]
clicked.set(whos)  #this refers to month
clickeds.set(who.day) #this refers to date
```

Here, we set the title to 'What's Your Luck?'. You can change the title to your preference.

```
lucktitle = Label(luckframe, text="What's Your Luck?", font=('Arial', 30))
lucktitle.grid(row=0, columnspan=4)
```

To create the calendar dropdown buttons:

```
frame0 = Frame(luckframe)
frame0.grid(row=1, columnspan=3)
```

To create the dropdown menu for Month:

```
drop = OptionMenu(frame0, clicked , *options )
drop.grid(row=1, column=0)
drop.config(bg="#ffe4f2", fg="BLACK", activebackground="#e54ed0", activeforeground="WHITE", width=30)
drop["menu"].config(bg="#e54ed0", fg="WHITE", activebackground="#ffe4f2", activeforeground="BLACK")
```

To create the dropdown menu for Date:

```
drops = OptionMenu(frame0, clickeds , *optionss )
drops.grid(row=1, column=1)
drops.config(bg="#9f45b0", fg="WHITE", activebackground="#44008b", activeforeground="WHITE", width=30)
drops["menu"].config(bg="#44008b", fg="WHITE", activebackground="#9f45b0", activeforeground="WHITE")
```

# **Test Your Concentration**

**Test Your Concentration** is a game where it challenges the users' ability to focus and select the correct answer within the given time limit. The game is called 'ICONcentrate', in which it has 4 stages, with the difficulty increasing each round. The program will randomly generate icons for each round, prompting the player to guess the correct icon shown on the polarizer panel.

<br>

![](markdown%20imgs/iconSS.png)
*Test Your Concentration GUI*

<br>

---

<br>

## **Code**

<br>

Firstly, we set the title to 'ICONcentrate'. You can change the title to your preference.

```
headername = Label(focusframe, text="ICONcentrate", font=('Arial', 30), fg='#96DED1') 
headername.grid(row=0, column=0)
```

Next, we created the **Instructions** button for the game, in which the user would need to click on the button so that a pop-up window would appear and show them the instructions.

```
instrubtn = Button(focusframe, text='Instructions', font=('Arial', 15), bg = '#b0c8ed', fg='white', command=getinstruction)
instrubtn.grid(row=1, column=0)
```





<br>

<br>

In order to view the values from the terminal, you will need to change the directory to the folder of the file. After changing the directory, you will need to enter `python3 filename.py` to print the output.


1. Open the terminal on Raspberry Pi.
2. In the terminal, type the following commands under this format: 
```
cd /Directory
```

Example:

```
cd /home/pi/Documents/EGL314/
```
3. Once inside the directory folder of your file, type in the following:

```
python3 main.py
```
